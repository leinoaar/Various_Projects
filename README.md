# Various Projects â€“ Portfolio

This repository collects a selection of my projects in data science, machine learning, and statistical analysis.  
Each folder contains a self-contained project with code, data (sampled if necessary), and documentation.  
The aim of this portfolio is to showcase different methods, tools, and problem-solving approaches I have applied.

I will continue to expand this archive with new projects covering a wide range of topics.
